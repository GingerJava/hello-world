# hello-world
My first repository. 
I'm a beginning coder. So far, I'm fairly confident with HTML and CSS. I am just learning JavaScript and it is a little more difficult than HTML and CSS but I'm getting through it. I would like to become either a front-end developer or a designer. Any and all suggestions are welcome.
